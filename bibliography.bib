@article{ampute,
	abstract = {Missing data form a ubiquitous problem in scientific research, especially since most statistical analyses require complete data. To evaluate the performance of methods dealing with missing data, researchers perform simulation studies. An important aspect of these studies is the generation of missing values in a simulated, complete data set: the amputation procedure. We investigated the methodological validity and statistical nature of both the current amputation practice and a newly developed and implemented multivariate amputation procedure. We found that the current way of practice may not be appropriate for the generation of intuitive and reliable missing data problems. The multivariate amputation procedure, on the other hand, generates reliable amputations and allows for a proper regulation of missing data problems. The procedure has additional features to generate any missing data scenario precisely as intended. Hence, the multivariate amputation procedure is an efficient method to accurately evaluate missing data methodology.},

@article{rubi76,
	abstract = {When making sampling distribution inferences about the parameter of the data, \texttheta, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are `missing at random' and the observed data are `observed at random', but these inferences are generally conditional on the observed pattern of missing data. When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about \texttheta, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is `distinct' from \texttheta. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.},

@article{scho18,
	abstract = {Missing data in scientific research go hand in hand with assumptions about the nature of the missingness. When dealing with missing values, a set of beliefs has to be formulated about the extent to which the observed data may also hold for the missing parts of the data. It is vital that the validity of these missingness assumptions is verified, tested, and that assumptions are adjusted when necessary. In this article, we demonstrate how observed data structures could a priori indicate whether it is likely that our beliefs about the missingness can be trusted. To this end, we simulate complete data and generate missing values according several types of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms. We demonstrate that in scenarios where the data correlations are either low or very substantial, strictly different mechanisms yield equivalent statistical inferences. In addition, we show that the choice of quantity of scientific interest together with the distribution of the nonresponse govern the validity of the missingness assumptions.},

@article{vink14,
	abstract = {Current pooling rules for multiply imputed data assume infinite populations. In some situations this assumption is not feasible as every unit in the population has been observed, potentially leading to over-covered population estimates. We simplify the existing pooling rules for situations where the sampling variance is not of interest. We compare these rules to the conventional pooling rules and demonstrate their use in a situation where there is no sampling variance. Using the standard pooling rules in situations where sampling variance should not be considered, leads to overestimation of the variance of the estimates of interest, especially when the amount of missingness is not very large. As a result, populations estimates are over-covered, which may lead to a loss of statistical power. We conclude that the theory of multiple imputation can be extended to the situation where the sample happens to be the population. The simplified pooling rules can be easily implemented to obtain valid inference in cases where we have observed essentially all units and in simulation studies addressing the missingness mechanism only.},
